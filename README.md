# Facebook-Live-Stream-Animation
Playing around with the Facebook Live Stream the other day, I found an interesting animation that I wanted to reproduce. let's look at how to animate some images across the screen using a curved path.   We'll be using a UIBezierPath to execute our animation.  After seeing it in action, let's also introduce some randomness to the various images that we add into our view.

Hello there, I'm Neri and in this repository, I'll be posting the code for the Facebook live animation that you see on my Instagram 
    [**@neri_iosdev**](https://www.instagram.com/neri_iosdev/).
    
I hope you'll learn something new and use this animation and concept to achieve great effects for your apps.
